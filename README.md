# Stack

You will implement a simple stack!

Stack is a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: 
* Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
* Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

Our stack will have a maximum size of 5 (integers) and must be LIFO (last in, first out).

Starting points:
- Create class stack
- Implement push 
- Implement pop

Bonus points:
- When stack is full and push new data - display "can't add anymore"
- When stack is empty and pop the data - display "there is nothing on the stack"
